# htmlnotes
I was bored, so I re-learnt html. I wrote my notes in html because ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I'm also gonna put my other web-related notes and stuff in this repo because though making a repo for every language I learn is cool,
I don't feel like making a repo and only putting like 4 files in it or something...

tl;dr all my web notes are going in here
(Jon is rlly cool)
