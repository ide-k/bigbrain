# bigbrain
I was bored, so I re-learnt html. I wrote my notes in html because ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ (note that this repo has been renamed to bigbrain)

I'm also gonna put my other programming notes and stuff in this repo because though making a repo for every language is cool,
I don't feel like making a repo and only putting like 4 files in it or something...

tl;dr all my programming notes
(Jon is rlly cool)
