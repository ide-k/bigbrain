<p>ctrl+u for src</p>

<p>
big difference between what you see in the editor and the actual page itself
</p>

<p>
whitespace is completely ignored by the browser. <br>
this includes:
<ul>
    <li>line breaks</li>
    <li>empty lines</li>
    <li>tabs or indents</li>
</ul>
to force a line break, you have to use the &lt;br&gt; tag <br>
for tabs, you need css which will be done later
