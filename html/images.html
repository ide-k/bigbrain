<p>ctrl+u for src
<br>
    its the first non textual content on the web <br>
    .jpg, .gif (animated), .png (transparent or not), .bmp, etc.<br><br>

    images use the &lt;img&gt; element which is <strong>self-closing</strong> (meaning it only has an opening tag)<br>
    you have to add the src attribute to define the locaion of the image<br>
    you can use relative or absolute links<br><br>
    for example, this spacecraft landing:<br>
    <img src="https://marksheet.io/images/soyuz-spacecraft.jpg"><br>

    dimensions:<br>
    every image has 2 dimensions (w and h), the image above is 394 x 284<br>
    in html, you don't need to specify dimensions, the browser auto inserts the image in its full size.<br>
    <br>
    &lt;img&gt; is technically an inline element because it closes itself (only has the opening tag)<br>
    so its an inline element like &lt;a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt; or &lt;em&gt;
    <br>
    images = content kings so they might show up in the middle of paragraphs<br>
    (make sure to include line breaks after images)
