<p>ctrl+u for src<br>

    webpages can be divided into 4 parts:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>header</strong> that is similar on every page, and is the main navigation for the entire site</li>
        <li><strong>main</strong> content that changes for every page, a list of articles (basically an about page)</li>
        <li><strong>sidebar</strong> that links to archives and categories</li>
        <li><strong>footer</strong> for additional links to less important pages</li>
    </ul>

    There are some elements you can use as containers for other elements<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Header</strong><br>
    acts as the intro to the webpage, with the logo, tagline and navigation links<br>
    <br>

    <strong>Footer</strong><br>
    as opposed to the header, the footer is usually the last element of a page,<br>
    where the main navigation links are repeated and secondary ones are added.<br>
    <br>

    <strong>Main</strong><br>
    The main element contains the <strong>most important content</strong> of the page that define the purpose of the page.<br>
    while all webpages contain common elements (like the header, and navigation), the main element focuses on unique content.<br>
    <br>

    <strong>Aside</strong><br>
    The aside element usually lives alongside the main and contains additional info related to the main content.<br>
    <br>

    <strong>Section</strong><br>
    The section element allows to group.
