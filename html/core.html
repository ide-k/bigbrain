    this file should be called <quote>links</quote> or something
<br>
    links are in line elements <br>
    &lt;href&gt; is used to define the target of the link
    <a href="https://www.google.ca">this is epic</a>

    <ul>
        <li>anchor targets, to navigate within the same page</li>
        <li>relative URLs to navigate within the same site</li>
        <li>absolute to navigate to another site</li>
        
    </ul>
<br>
    for anchors: <br>
    do href, but with a # to navigate to a &lt;div&gt; with the same id
<br>
    for relative urls:<br>
    its relative to the <strong>current page</strong><br>
    if you want to move to a different page, just href the .html file <br>
    <a href="inline.html">this is a different note</a>
<br>
    for absolute urls:<br>
    you need the complete url<br>
    <ul>
        <li>protocol --> https://</li>
        <li>domain --> domain.com</li>
        <li>file path --> filename.html</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    this contains all the info to find the correct file.<br>
    you can link your socials on your pages and stuff
    <br>
    or just go to google like a lazy person
    here is <a href="https://google.ca/">google</a> :)
