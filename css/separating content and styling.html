<p>ctrl+u for src 

    as web grew in popularity (90s), ppl wanted to add designs to websites.<br>
    web devs relied on specific tags to enhance pages:
    <ul>
        <li>&lt;basefont&gt; -> defined a font for a while html document</li>
        <li>&lt;font&gt; -> defined a typeface, a color, and a size for the text it contains</li>
        <li>&lt;center&gt; -> horizontally centered all its content</li>
        <li>&lt;big&gt; -> increased the size of text</li>
        <li>&lt;strike&gt; -> strikethrough</li>
    </ul>

    Several attributes could also be used:
    <ul>
        <li>bgcolor -> defined a bg colour on the element</li>
        <li>text -> defined the text colour</li>
        <li>several margin attributes could be used to add space on any side of the element</li>
    </ul>

    Avoid tables because they're dumb. too time consuming and too much formatting.<br>
    ppl use css instead of tables because tables take too much work and everyone is lazy like me lol<br>
    <br>

    CSS = Cascading Style Sheet<br>
    its used to style markup languages because plain text looks bad<br>
    therefore css is worthless on its own.<br>
    It brings an html doc to life, you can choose fonts, apply colours, define margins, position elements,<br>
    animate interactions and a lot more.<br>
    <br>
    
    How CSS works<br>
    you select the html element (like a paragraph), choose a property to alter (like colour),<br>
    and apply a certain value to the property (like red):<br>
    (p{ color: red;})<br>
    <br>

    Where to write CSS:<br>
    <strong>CSS is an attribut</strong><br>
    you can write css directly on an html element by using the (style) attribute:<br>
    (&lt;p style=<quotes>color: red;</quotes>&gt;) --> this will give red text<br>
    <br>

    CSS in the &lt;head&gt;<br>
    you can use &lt;style&gt; in the &lt;head&gt;<br>
    <br>

    CSS in a separate file:<br>
    you can write css in a separate file with a .css extension and then link it to your<br>
    html by using the <strong>&lt;link&gt; html tag</strong><br>
    people usually use this method (in a different file)<br>
    <br>
    
    The reason why ppl dont css directly in html is because it looks like ass and ppl have decency (usually)<br>
    it also makes maintenance easier, the same css file can be used for a whole website<br>
    it provides flexibility: focus on the content on one side (html), and style on the other (css).
